  <b>Figure 1:</b> A generic information flow for a desired MR functionality G with an attacker J which can perform adversarial inference off line to determine the space the user is in as well as the objects within the space: (1) adversarial inference modeling or learning from, say, historical 3D data, and (2) adversarial inference or matching over currently released 3D data<br>

AR/MR platforms such as [Google ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/), [Apple ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit), and [Windows Mixed Reality API](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/windows-mixed-reality) requires spatial understanding of the user environment in order to deliver virtual augmentations that seemingly inhabit the real world, and, in some immersive examples, even interact with physical objects. The captured spatial information is stored digitally as a spatial map or graph of 3D points, called a *point cloud*, which is accompanied by mesh information to indicate how the points, when connected, represent surfaces and other structures in the user environment. However, these 3D spatial maps that may contain sensitive information can be stored and accessed by a potential adversary (as shown in Fig. 1), and be further utilized for functionalities beyond the application's intended function such as aggressive localized advertisements. And, so far, there are *no* mechanisms in place that ensure user data privacy in MR platforms.

In light of this, first, we present an attacker that not only recognizes the general space, i.e. *inter-space*, but also infers the user’s location within the space, i.e. *intra-space*. To construct the attacker, we build up on existing place and shape recognition methods that have been applied on 3D lidar data and modify it to the scale on which 3D data is captured by MR platforms. We demonstrate how easy it is to extend these 3D recognition methods to be used as an attacker in the MR scenario. Then, we present *spatial plane generalizations* with *conservative plane releasing* as a simple privacy approach which we insert as an intermediary layer of protection as shown in Fig. 2. For the attackers, we employed two different methods: NN-matcher which uses a *intrinsic* 3D descriptor matching, and the *deep neural network*-based [pointnetvlad](https://github.com/mikacuy/pointnetvlad).

Results show that revealing no more than 11 *generalized* planes--accumulated from revealed spaces with large enough radius, i.e. *r*≤1.0m--can make an adversary fail in identifying the spatial location of the user for at least half of the time. Furthermore, if the accumulated spaces are of smaller radius, i.e. *r*≤ 0.5m, we can release up to 29 generalized planes while enjoying both better data utility and privacy.

# SAMPLE CODE

Pre-requisites
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scipy, scikit-learn
* HDF5
* Bz2

Pre-requisites for DNN-based pointnetVLAD
* tensorflow

Sample generalized data is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IMVuLJxuKeV9HchGY1Wet5IabK2NS4hc) (Download and unpack the ZIP files). Put the ransac_pc directory outside of this cloned repo. Then, put the unzipped (pre-trained) model directory inside this repo.


The notebook [00-generate-samples-and-submaps.ipynb](https://github.com/spatial-privacy/3d-spatial-privacy/blob/master/00-generate-samples-and-submaps.ipynb) generates the samples given the provided raw point clouds and generalized pointclouds. The notebook [01-one-time-partials-with-nn-matcher.ipynb](https://github.com/spatial-privacy/3d-spatial-privacy/blob/master/01-one-time-partials-with-nn-matcher.ipynb) contains a step-by-step replication of the validation and testing using the NN-matcher over one-time released partial spaces but with only 300 sample iterations (you can change this value). It uses prepared sample data for various scenarios. Similary, the notebook [02-successive-with-nn-matcher.ipynb](https://github.com/spatial-privacy/3d-spatial-privacy/blob/master/02-successive-with-nn-matcher.ipynb) shows spatial inference using the NN-matcher over successively released generalized partial spaces. While the notebook [03-inference-with-pointnetvlad.ipynb](https://github.com/spatial-privacy/3d-spatial-privacy/blob/master/03-inference-with-pointnetvlad.ipynb) shows spatial inference using the pointnetvlad for both one-time and successively released generalized partial spaces. It also plots the pointnetvlad performance against the NN-matcher.

Overall, we vary the following parameters on both Raw spaces and [RANSAC] generalized spaces: 
1. the size, i.e radius, of the revealed space
2. the number of successively released partial spaces
3. the number of *generalized* planes released

</p>

For our dataset, we gathered real 3D point cloud data using the Microsoft HoloLens in various environments to demonstrate the leakage from actual human-scale spaces in which an MR device is usually used. As shown in Fig. 5, our collected environments include the following spaces: a work space, a reception area, an office kitchen or pantry, an apartment, a drive way, a hall way, and a stair well.

</p>

In this work, we present *conservative plane releasing*, where we limit the number of planes a generalization produces. Fig. 6a shows an example set of planes that are released after RANSAC generalization of the revealed partial raw spaces (in Fig. 6b). Then, we can limit the maximum allowable planes that can be released, say, a maximum of 3 planes in total. As we can see in Fig. 6c, both partial releases produces only 3 planes.
